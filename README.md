# Housing Data Preprocessing Project

This project focuses on preprocessing housing data using Python. The code is designed to clean and prepare the dataset for further analysis, with a particular emphasis on handling outliers, missing values, variable transformation, correlation analysis, ANOVA, and creating dummy variables.

## Code Structure

### 1. Data Outlier Detection and Treatment

The initial step involves identifying and treating outliers in the target variable, 'Sale Price.' Outliers are visualized using scatter plots and boxplots, and then a limit imputer function is applied to handle extreme values. This ensures a more robust and reliable target variable for subsequent analyses.

### 2. Missing Values Handling

Missing values are identified in both the target variable and independent variables. For the target variable, rows with missing values are dropped, and for quantitative independent variables, SimpleImputer is used to fill missing values with the median. For categorical independent variables, the most frequent strategy is employed. This ensures a complete and consistent dataset.

### 3. Variable Transformation

- **Zipcode:** Converted to an object type for better representation.
- **No of Times Visited:** Mapped categorical values to numerical equivalents for improved interpretability.
- **New Variables:** 'Ever Renovated,' 'Purchase Year,' and 'Years Since Renovation' are derived to make the dataset more informative. These new variables contribute additional insights into the housing data.

### 4. Correlation Analysis

Correlation among categorical variables is explored using bar plots to understand their impact on the target variable, 'Sale Price.' This analysis helps identify potential relationships between categorical features and the sale price.

### 5. ANOVA

ANOVA tests are conducted to assess the impact of categorical variables on 'Sale Price.' F-values and p-values are analyzed to determine the significance of the differences in average mean values. This statistical analysis aids in understanding the significance of categorical variables in predicting sale prices.

### 6. Dummy Variables

Categorical variables are converted to numerical using one-hot encoding to be used in regression models. This step is crucial for incorporating categorical features into machine learning models.

### 7. Binning

Zipcodes are grouped into bins based on the mean 'Sale Price' to reduce the number of unique values and simplify the dataset. This binning process enhances the interpretability and generalization of the model.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
